## Exercise 6
'''
Follow the steps:

1. Create a class, Triangle. Its __init__() method should take self, angle1, angle2, and angle3 as arguments. Make sure to set these appropriately in the body of the __init__()method.
2. Create a variable named number_of_sides and set it equal to 3.
3. Create a method named check_angles. The sum of a triangle's three angles is It should return True if the sum of self.angle1, self.angle2, and self.angle3 is equal 180, and False otherwise.
4. Create a variable named my_triangle and set it equal to a new instance of your Triangle class. Pass it three angles that sum to 180 (e.g. 90, 30, 60).
5. Print out my_triangle.number_of_sides and print out my_triangle.check_angles().

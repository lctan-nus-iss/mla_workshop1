## Exercise 3
'''
Write a shutting down program:

First, def a function, shut_down, that takes one argument s. 

Then, if the shut_down function receives an s equal to "yes", it should return "Shutting down" 

Alternatively, elif s is equal to "no", then the function should return "Shutdown aborted". 

Finally, if shut_down gets anything other than those inputs, the function should return "Sorry".
